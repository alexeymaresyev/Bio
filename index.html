<p style = "font-family: georgia;" ALIGN = center >Intro/Part One:<br><br>
• Beginning of the book is somewhat immersive, leaving me to believe that there’s a possibility that it will become lame around the middle-end proportion. It starts of with the perspective of an elk that harmoniously gets disturbed by the chaotic infiltration into the natural reality. The elk goes on with its daily minutiae tasks as the looming sounds of battle continue above, almost as if the gods are fighting with themselves. Soon, this sense of safety is broken by a ship crash landing, thus steering away the predator that was about to pounce on the elk. Instead the furry bear goes towards the human in the snow, the snow crunching (as the author stated). That man was Alexey Maresyev. Luck was on his side…. This time.
<br><br>
• Encountered severe pain during his time of survival, amputated legs only allowed him to travel 10-5 kilometers max. Thus, due to starvation, he eat massive amounts of snow in a animal-like manner that would frighten anyone. To stay conscious, he made sure he counted every step, unfortunately, he eventually lost count after 500 steps due to the severe pain that was described as lightning being shot through his entire body during his time of recovering with the cynical nurse. 
<br><br>
• A fox, a “Bobik” dog, a hedgehog, and other insects/animals were encountered. During the fox encounter, Petrovich states that it is said that when animals follow you, that means death is close. He kept an optimistic mind throughout his amputated quest for survival, not only breaking his toes, but his nails, meaning that at one point he had to start crawling with his shoulders, which was an “awkward” experience according to Petrovich. 
<br><br>
• Petrovich survived 11 days out in the freezing wild--spend 7 days recovering in a Russian home.
<br><br>
• According to Andrei’s calculations in the novel, a friend that managed to find his amputated comrade in a small home in the woods stated that it might have took Alexey 11 days to get to safety, which was alarming at the time. Of course, a very infinitesimal amount of articles in Russian state that it in fact took Petrovich 18 days - “survived 18 days in the frozen wilderness”. This is only some non-minutiae information by Igor Rozin, but it is useful to take this into account. Due to the euphoric experience that Andrei (and Petrovich) encountered -“ejaculations of excitement” (questionable writing)- It is safe to say that this miscalculation on the specific days in the woods probably were longer than hitherto. Nevertheless, the horrific details that one encountered in the novel were daunting, at one point I questioned the writing style, I was certainly worried that most of it was an illusion (Paul Bateman Style of illusions). 
<br><br>
• The children that encountered Alexey were also cruel, almost as cruel as the snowy environment, cautiously making sure that Petrovich wasn’t a “fascist German” out to kill his family. I believe that at one point the child stated that the Germans acted as if they were Russian to survive in Russian territory, thus, this kid had had been forced by the war to stay in this cautious aware state of survival.
<br><br>
• The nurse/doctor that assisted Petrovich during his time of hurting had had biased/a cautious behavior while Petrovich recovered due to the fact that the German “fascists” apparently murder most of her family (I’m sure anybody would be worried…. The “grandad” in the home told Alexey in his semi-conscious state not to condemn her due to her experiences. 
<br><br>
• The point of the story is simply that, an average man (according to his friend Andrei) like Alexey Petrovich Maresyev could survive extreme temperatures just to come back to normalcy. Humans will do anything to get to their destination, even if odds are not in favor of the individual. Instread, Petrovich pushed forward exclaiming, “Nonesense! How utterly absurd! Everything will be all right”. This positive attitude has proved to us various times that the best way to best all odds in survival (and other temptations) is to afford the redress to continue forward. Pushing yourself to the limit even if no one will follow, the man in the corner. 
<br><br>
• His comrades were excited to see him arrive. The soldiers were cautious to see Petrovich in the state that he was, thus he was going to be sent to surgeons/specialists in Moscow that can “make the dead walk”. Not-surprisingly Petrovich declined this, he wanted to stay with his comrades, being with them made the pain of his body virtually nonexistent. 
<br><br>
• The minutiae details of Petrovich’s barating pain approbated by the senses only means that the body is still registering the host as active in the current time. He is described by his friends (mostly Andrei) as a determined individual. The determined face he owns applies even for his philosophy (whatever that happens to be).
