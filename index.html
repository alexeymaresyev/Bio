<p style ="font-family:georgia;">“I’m a man, not a hero” -Alexey Petrovich Maresyev</p>

<p style = "font-family: georgia;" ALIGN = center >Who is Alexey Petrovich Maresyev?<br><br>
It starts off with the perspective of an elk that, harmoniously gets disturbed by the chaotic infiltration into the natural reality. The elk goes on with its daily minutiae tasks as the looming sounds of battle roar above, almost as if a bunch of imbeciles are fighting due to divergence in belief. This sense of safety is broken by a plane crash landing, steering away from the predator that was about to pounce on the elk. The bear goes towards the human in the snow, crunching. That man was Alexey Maresyev. Face loss for words, confused, stranded, where were his friends now. Fighting for a modicum of premonition revealed through rumination. The trigger ignites adrenaline in the individual, war has always been survival. The bear heard the sound flourishing from the direction Alexey was laying. The bear starts to get near Alexey. Alexey shoots the bear, blood slithering away like a mouse. He stands, starts walking while the pain of a manic knife penetrating every finger on his feet causes a physical reaction that is full of various emotions. Fear, hatred, pain, anxiety, and the feeling of melancholy as he starts counting every step awaiting his arrival. Will he make it back to his friends? Will he make it back home?
<br><br>
Alexey was introduced to severe pain during his time of expectation of durability, hence the fact he attended the Military School of Aviation (to read more about his past, feel free to check out the "His Young Life" tab). Amputated legs only allowed him to travel 10-5 kilometers max. Thus, due to starvation, he eats regales snow in animal-like mannerism that should frighten most people. To stay conscious, he made sure he considered every individual step, unfortunately, he eventually lost count after 500 steps due to the severe pain that was described as lightning being shot through his entire body during his time of recovering with a cynical nurse, similar enough resemblance to her children that acted sardonically excessive with Alexey.
<br><br>
A fox, a “Bobik” dog, a hedgehog, and other creatures were encountered. During the fox encounter, Alexey states that when animals follow you, “death is close”. He kept an optimistic mind throughout his amputated quest for survival, not only breaking his toes, but also his nails. At one point he had to start crawling with his shoulders, which was an “awkward” mechanical process according to Boris Polevoi.
<br><br>
Alexey survived 18 days out in the cold retiring a couple of days in a Russian home.
<br><br>
According to Andrei’s considerations in the novel, a friend that managed to find his amputated comrade in a small home in the woods stated that it might have taken Alexey 18 days to get to safety, which was alarming if we acknowledge this period. It took Petrovich 18 days to reach a suitable stop, “survived 18 days in the frozen wilderness”. This is only some non-minutiae information by Igor Rozin, but it is useful to take this into account. Due to the euphoric experience that Andrei (and Alexey) encountered “ejaculations of excitement”. It is safe to say that this miscalculation on the specific days in the woods probably was longer than hitherto. Nevertheless, the horrific details that one encountered in the novel were daunting, at one point I questioned the writing style, I was certainly worried that most of it were an illusion (Paul Bateman Style of illusions). 
<br><br>
The children that encountered Alexey were also cruel, almost as cruel as the snowy environment, cautiously making sure that Alexey wasn’t a “fascist German” out to kill his family. I believe that at one point the child stated that the Germans acted as if they were Russian to survive in Russian territory, thus, this kid had been forced by the war to stay in this cautious aware state of survival.
<br><br>
The make-belief accolated doctor that aided Alexey during his interval of hurting had swayed behavior while Alexey recovered due to the fact that the German “fascists” apparently murdered most of her family (I’m sure anybody would be worried…. The fatherly personage in the home told Alexey in his semi-sentient state not to condemn her for her experiences).
<br><br>
The point of the story is simply that, an average man (according to his friend Andrei) like Alexey Petrovich Maresyev could survive extreme temperatures just to come back to normalcy. Humans will do anything to get to their destination, even if odds are not in favor of the individual. Instead, Alexey pushed forward exclaiming, “Nonsense! How utterly absurd! Everything will be all right”. This positive attitude has proved to us various times that the best way to outperform all odds in survival (and other temptations) is to afford the redress to continue forward. Pushing yourself to the limit even if no one will follow, the man in the corner.
<br><br>
His comrades were excited to see him arrive. The soldiers were cautious to see Alexey in the state that he was, thus he was going to be sent to surgeons/specialists in Moscow that can “make the dead walk”. Not-surprisingly Alexey declined this, he wanted to stay with his comrades, being with them made the pain of his body virtually nonexistent.
<br><br>
The minutiae details of Alexey's berating pain approbated by the senses only means that the body is still registering the host as active in the current time. He is described by his friends (mostly Andrei) as a determined individual. The determined face he owns applies even for his philosophy (whatever that happens to be).

<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:georgia;">The Man that Lived 11-18 Days in Freezing Temperatures to Escape From Nazi "Fascists" (Conclusion)<br>
<br>
Our disregarded champion was less of a warrior and more of a dedicated survivor. He crashes in a forest in the grasp of winter. His venerated aircraft Polikarpov I-16 beneficial during this era (recovered by the military to materialize it into scrap later when it was found). He was temporarily alienated during the catastrophe due to the demolished engine. Surprised to have lived the crash, Alexey suddenly interacted with a brown bear that appeared. Alexey shot it with a gun.
<br><br>
After this courageous occurrence, he went through rigorous efforts to make it back to his comrades.18 days in the forest without many possible virtues, the only reason to live was survival. The thought of being with his friends was enough to help him engage in deep purpose. He made it into a Russian home that happened to have an experienced doctor that took care of him until the rare encounter of his friend Andrei. Everyone celebrated his success, a pilot that didn't want special service at Moscow—he wanted to be beside his friends. A normal man with astonishing determination for survival. People called him a hero, a legend. A real man.
<br><br>
“There’s nothing extraordinary in what I did. The fact that I’ve been turned into a legend irritates me.” -Alexey Petrovich Maresyev
